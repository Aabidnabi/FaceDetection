# Face Detection & Tracking Using OpenCV & Haar Cascade Frontal Face Algorithm
This  Aim of this project  is to recognize the facial expression of a person in real-time using the webcam ,I used OpenCV  & Haarcascade FrontalFace Algorithm to get the face image and Convolutional Neural Nets to classify the images.
